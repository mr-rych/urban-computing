**Sunfall: Visualizing Urban Canopy Coverage & Heat Vulnerability in NYC**


This Colab-based project analyzes the relationship between urban tree canopy coverage and heat vulnerability across New York City using publicly available datasets. It proposes a custom Canopy Scoring Index based on tree trunk diameter (DBH), informed by ecological scaling principles, and visualizes spatial patterns across NYC census tracts.

The work was inspired by ARCH 5310: Design Tactics of Urban Computing, taught by Professor Carlos Sandoval Olascoaga, which introduced methods for urban data analysis through code, mapping, and public datasets.

**📘 Project Structure**

Part 0: Preparation — Imports and setup

Part 1: Urban Canopy Coverage Index - Tree DBH binning rationale - Scoring system design

Part 2: Spatial Join and Census Tract Mapping - Geo-data merge with tract-level stats

Part 3: Heat Vulnerability Integration - Normalized UHI scoring and shade adjustment

Part 4: Exploratory Visualizations - Tract-level patterns in green coverage, risk, and mitigation gaps

**🗂️ Datasets Used:**

NYC Tree Census (2015) via NYC OpenData, and NYC Census Tract Geometries

**🛠️ Technologies:**

Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Folium), Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebook
